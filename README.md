# Martin Enke

Full-stack & GenAI Application Engineer building LLM-powered, production-ready applications with Python, FastAPI, Flask, React, and Next.js. I focus on practical AI integrations – RAG pipelines, automated workflows, audio analysis tools, and transparent evaluation systems.

My background includes 17+ years in audio engineering and technical systems, shaping a structured, reliable, and user-focused approach to problem-solving. I enjoy building thoughtful architectures, clear workflows, and AI-enhanced tools that support real work in both technical and creative environments.

## About Me

I’m a full-stack engineer focused on GenAI applications — systems that help people work faster, think clearer, or create more freely.  

Before software, I spent over 17 years in audio engineering, which taught me calm problem-solving under pressure, disciplined workflows, and high standards for reliability.  

I’m interested in systems thinking, philosophy, astronomy, and how technology shapes creative work. I try to build tools that feel intentional rather than noisy — sensible data flows, clear boundaries, and AI features that improve the experience instead of complicating it.

## What I’m Focused On

I recently completed a 12-month Backend & AI Engineering program at  
[Masterschool](https://learn.masterschool.com/) and I’m expanding further into full-stack development and applied AI.

### Current interests
- LLM-driven full-stack architectures (Python, FastAPI, React, Next.js)  
- RAG pipelines, retrieval strategies, and evaluation of AI system behavior  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)  
- Audio tooling, feature extraction, creative automation  
- BMAD-style iterative engineering loops (build/measure/adjust/deploy)  

In November I’ll begin a two-month engineering internship at  
[webeet](https://www.webeet.io/) to contribute to real production systems.

## Projects I Maintain

The pinned repositories below are the projects I continue to refine —  
AI-assisted analysis, creative tools, fair scoring systems, and production-ready GenAI features.

If something resonates with what you’re exploring, I’m always open to connecting. :))
