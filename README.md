# Martin Enke

Full-stack & GenAI Application Engineer building LLM-powered, production-ready applications with Python, FastAPI, Flask, React, and Next.js. My work centers on practical AI integrations—RAG pipelines, automated workflows, audio analysis tools, and transparent evaluation systems.

With a long background in technical systems and audio engineering, I approach software with structured problem-solving, reliability, and a focus on meaningful user outcomes. I enjoy creating clear systems, thoughtful workflows, and AI-enhanced tools that support real work in both technical and creative domains.

## About Me

I’m a full-stack engineer with a focus on practical GenAI integrations. Before moving into tech, I spent over 17 years working in audio engineering—designing systems, solving technical problems under pressure, and building structured workflows. That background shaped the way I approach software today: clear architecture, reliable execution, and tools that genuinely help people get work done.

I enjoy building applications where AI adds real value, whether through automation, smarter feedback loops, or workflows that feel intuitive rather than complex. Outside of coding, I’m deeply interested in philosophy, astronomy, sociology, and how technology influences creative work.  
Always open to conversations, new ideas, and opportunities to collaborate.

## What I’m Working On

I recently completed a 12-month Backend & AI Engineering program at [Masterschool](https://learn.masterschool.com/).  
I'm now expanding my frontend experience to get a full view of the entire stack, while exploring how GenAI can meaningfully enhance real products and workflows.

I enjoy being part of the developer community—joining meetups, learning from others, and staying close to new developments in tech.  
At the end of November, I’ll start a two-month engineering internship at [webeet](https://www.webeet.io/), where I’m excited to contribute to production work and learn from real-world engineering processes.

Current areas of exploration include:
- Full-stack architectures with Python + React/Next.js  
- RAG systems and efficient retrieval setups  
- Model context protocol (MCP) patterns  
- Building modular backend micro-services (BMAD-style thinking)  
- Audio tooling, Web Audio workflows, and creative AI software

## Projects I Continue to Develop

My main ongoing projects are pinned below—they’re the ones I actively refine, extend, and learn from.  
If something here resonates, I’m always open to discussion or collaboration.
