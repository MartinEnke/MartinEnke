## About Me

I’m a full-stack engineer with a focus on GenAI applications – tools that help people work faster, think clearer, or create more.  
Before moving into software engineering, I worked for over 17 years in audio engineering and technical systems, which shaped a way of working that values structure, reliability, and calm problem-solving under pressure.

I like building systems that feel intentional rather than noisy: clear boundaries, sensible data flows, and AI features that add real value instead of complexity. Outside of code, I’m drawn to philosophy, astronomy, sociology, and how technology shapes creative work and culture.

## What I’m Focused On

I recently completed a 12-month Backend & AI Engineering program at  
<a href="https://learn.masterschool.com/">Masterschool</a> and I’m continuing to deepen my full-stack and AI application skills.

At the end of November, I’ll be starting a two-month engineering internship at  
<a href="https://www.webeet.io/">webeet</a>, contributing to production systems and learning from real-world product teams.

Besides that I’m particularly interested in:

- Full-stack architectures with Python, FastAPI, React, and Next.js  
- RAG systems, retrieval strategies, and evaluation of LLM behavior  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) and better ways to structure AI tooling  
- Modular backend design and BMAD-like build/measure/adjust/deploy loops  
- Audio tooling, analysis workflows, and creative automation with AI

## Projects I Continue to Develop

The main projects I actively refine and extend are pinned below. They capture the direction I’m moving in:  
AI-assisted analysis, fair evaluation, and creative automation.

If any of these align with what you’re building or exploring, I’m always open to conversations and collaboration.
